# Logo File

Place your company logo here as `logo.png`

## Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG (recommended for transparency)
- **Size**: Any size (will be auto-resized to 1/6 of QR code)
- **Background**: Transparent background recommended
- **Recommended dimensions**: 500x500px or higher

## Tips:
- Use a simple, recognizable logo
- Avoid very detailed logos (may not display well when small)
- Test the final QR code to ensure it scans correctly
- Higher resolution is better for print quality

The current `logo.png` in this repository is just an example. Replace it with your own logo before generating QR codes.
